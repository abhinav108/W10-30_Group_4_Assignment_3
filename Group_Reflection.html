                            Working as part of the team was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot in the process. As a group, we assigned roles and responsibilities to each member, allowing everyone to contribute equally. Working in groups has increased my collaborative abilities. Working in a group provided me with new views and enabled me to address more complicated issues than I could alone. We held frequent meetings (2 official meetings with all members and 3-4 informal meetings while working on the project) and used to create meeting agendas and minutes, much like the prior time, which helped me learn how to plan ahead and manage my time properly. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our group had six members, all of whom I found to be extremely supportive, which surprised me. My teammates had to acquire new skills along the way so that they could work towards the project, such as Figma, Blender and Moviestorm softwares. It was difficult when they started off working with it but after a few days they became comfortable with it and produced the results as expected. I was given the task of designing the architectural prototype model for Food Tunnelz, and I was in charge of two sections: Aims and Plans and Progress. We utilised Microsoft Teams and Canvas for meetings, announcements, and discussions, Google Docs for sharing our work, and github for sharing the group website.

                            As in my reflection in assignment 2, I believe that our team was a well-balanced group. The members of the team were hard working, smart and understanding of the different situations the other members of the group were facing in their respective countries. Despite the multiple issues faced by the team, in my opinion, we can be satisfied with the end submission for the assignment 3. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This was possible due to correcting many issues, errors and mistakes that were committed by the members of the team in assignment 2. We began this project with a discussion on these mistakes and issues, and the steps we can take to overcome to not repeat the same mistakes. This helped the team a lot. As in assignment 2, tasks were delegated, taking into considerations the strengths and weaknesses of each member of the team. Steps were taken to eradicate any communication issues that we faced in the previous assignment and made sure that we had easier methods to directly communicate with each member. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This assignment allowed me to personally learn new things that I had not known before, such as the development of a prototype of a mobile app through Figma. Despite these changes and improvements, I still believe that the team could have done better, though at the same time I believe that we are submitting a very satisfactory assignment 3.

                            The team's participation in the team meeting during assignment 3 was outstanding. We had some timing concerns at first due to the different countries, but everything went smoothly. Each team member pays close attention to his team's meeting and task that is provided. We distributed our work across members in the same way we did before. One thing our group should improve is completing our assigned tasks ahead of schedule so that we can discuss those sections with each other. What I find remarkable about our group is how well we work together. Each team member not only gives his all in this project, but also assists other team members who are stuck. Another unexpected aspect was learning new skills in order to perform delegated tasks. I learnt a lot about groups, such as how participating in one increases my high-level learning and critical thinking abilities. Furthermore, it inspires me to pursue my goals and develop new skills. I also learned how to look at and solve problems from a variety of angles. Furthermore, interacting with other members of the group relieves my stress about education. 
                            <br />
                            I solved various problems that I faced during completion of my task with the help of other team members. With the support of other team members, I was able to tackle numerous challenges that I encountered while completing my task.

                            Working as group throughout the whole semester was interesting. We were fortunate to have very understanding group members. The group members were able to communicate effectively and contributions to the assignments remained consistent. Everything from the delegation of the tasks to each group member, to the successful completion of those tasks was remarkably smooth. I was surprised at the willingness of the group to meet daily through informal meeting to resolve any issues. We were only able to hold 2 formal meeting per week due to the stringent requirements of course, however we met informally plenty of times. In hindsight, due to this very reason our group was able to get along so well toward the end of the semester. Without the looming thought of being recorded we were able to be ourselves and create a stronger bond. However poor communication has remained an issue within the team. Most meeting were delayed, and had it not been for a more understanding group of students, these delays could have led to bigger problems. In the future it is recommended that all group members take the responsibility to attend the meeting on time and further reminders should not be necessary. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Our group consisted of 6 members, two of which were studying from India. I found their willingness to cooperate with our time zones surprising. One of our meeting was held at 11am AEST, which would make it 5am Indian standard time. Their willingness to attend this meeting was commendable to the say the least. Overall, I am very satisfied with this group, especially since most of us had to learn new skills in order to produce the deliverables of this assignment.  Having had almost no experience with most of the tasks delegated, the results we have shown go beyond my expectation.

                            I believe that our group performed much better compared to how we performed in Assignment 2 because this time most members of our group was able to submit their work on time. At start of Assignment 3 our work was divided into 3 parts in which 4 members – Me(Sahib), Ayodhya, Mussab and Duo was working on figma, Abihav was working on physical design of project and Karandeep worked on 3D model this way we were able to complete most of the practical tasks by week 10 with having remaining 2 weeks to finish group report and website. Because this time our group was more organised in dividing and providing finished parts in time, we were able to compete this assignment in its best form. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This time our group was also able to improve upon their communication. In this assignment each and every member of our group was communicating a lot with each other and attending group meetings on time thought the start of assignment which can be seen through our teams logs, agenda and meetings. Because of our group’s good communication in this assignment, we managed to complete all parts of assignment on designated time. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            One thing that our group could improve upon is that we managed to complete all parts on time however we were still working on the assignment on the last day and rushing to submit it. Our group can improve further on how to manage their time in completing assignment so that we can submit the assignments one day before the due date.  
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Overall, our group contribution in tasks were evenly distributed with improved communication skills compared to previous assignment that’s why we managed to submit the assignment in its best quality and on time.

                            Cooperation for Assignment 3 has been better completed than during Assignment 2, mostly since meetings are more frequent and attended by most in the group, which then leads to clearer task goals of each component and the workload allocation, therefore coordination was clearer and it allowed plenty of time for members to complete, and then fine tune each one’s individual component, and then merge it together into one single report. This can be reflected in the quality of Figma work completed by each member, which was overall comprised of high quality, thorough design of each function inside the app. Also, credit to Abhinav for finishing the thorough and descriptive 3D modelling for the Food Tunnelz  concept unit, which comes at significant time and effort. The modelling has reflected the goal of Food Tunnelz  concept well, which is designed to be a safe and intimate dining and meeting space, also incorporating takeaways. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            However, there are still components that can be improved. Such as the time and effort input into this project, where some elements in Figma are deemed as imperfect, and the realisation of the concept, that has only covered most part of the plan, and feasibility may not be exactly the best, real life terms.

                            <br />
                            As in assignment 2, we were able to manage and organise our group in such a way that everyone had an equal amount of workload to complete, and we prioritised our work accordingly so that everyone in the group could complete their share of work before each deadline. We made sure that certain aspects of assignments were completed before certain dates so that we had ample time to fix any errors or issues before the due time. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We began the assignment by identifying and discussing the errors and mistakes the team made in the previous assignment. We discussed on how we can make sure theses mistakes and errors do not repeat. The team as a whole did a good job in stopping a majority of these from occurring again.

                            <br />
                            There were again times where we had difficulty in conducting our meetings at the pre-planned time as some members were occupied with their work or were not at a place where they could appropriately join the meeting. Therefore, meetings had to be cancelled or postponed. This had a negative impact on the assignment and the timely preparation of it. Improving on that would mean that any work which has not been completed by any of the team members can be completed timely, and so we do not have to rush in any way before the deadline and submit our work in an excellent quality.

                            One thing we need to stress on is that every member of the group is dedicated, smart and has their own strengths. Each member of the group contributed the required amount of work and in fact more than what was required to complete the assignment. This was despite of their busy work life or the unbelievable pandemic situation in India where two of our members are based in. It was again clearly evident that working in groups remotely is not as easy as you would think, as the situations that each of our members are in varied a lot.

                            Our GitHub logs does not represent how well our group performed on the assignment as we divided work equally with everyone. Our group decided that only one person will work on website and each of the other individuals will work on their part of assignment. This was done as that one person was highly knowledgeable in HTML site development. Instead of GitHub the minutes of the formal group meetings, messages and even informal group meeting on teams clearly represent how well the group worked on the assignment.
