                            <br />

                            <b>5. Game designer – (Mussab)  </b>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            To design, test and produce live, graphic-heavy video games powered by advanced gaming engines. Excellent graphic production, 3D modelling and human-machine interaction skills required due to the graphic-heavy nature of games and the complexity of turning real-life photos into gaming scenes. 

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The reason for Chief Information Officers to be perceived as important to employers is since CIO (Chief Information Officer) is generally a new position created to manage the entire company's IT works and systems, in an environment that is increasingly reliant on information technology. However, it is also the most competitive due to the sheer number of applicants interested in the job. Their ideal candidate will be those who proved to have experiences in manage large systems and making every day IT tasks easier for their fellow employees. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The second in importance would be mobile app design, as currently 54% of world's internet traffic comes from mobile phones as opposed to computers (Statista 2021) and on average, 90% of time spent on phones are spent on apps while just 10% is used to browse a website (Haklander 2021). These two research alone justified investments in mobile app, in addition to that, a better interface on apps translates to a better experience, hence it attracts more users. The most desirable candidate would be able to produce smooth and visually appealing mobile applications for clients across various industries with know-hows in both graphic design and coding the desired programs, such as Swift, a native programming language for iOS apps. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The third would be IT automation, it does not come far behind in employers’ demands. In virtually any industries, it is transitioning from manual labour to automation, a process that requires significant amount of time to set up and adjust. An ideal candidate for employers will need to prove themselves in terms of successful smoothening the automation transition process, that heavily involves complex coding with the appropriate software, and more, to ensure the new automation will work to desired setup. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The fourth one is proactive security, it is another important field that is sought after by employers, in an age where cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, in fact, sometimes carried out by conventional national military forces. Any failures in cybersecurity may contribute to losses that may amount to billions for a transnational corporation. In this case, the employers are seeking those who has independent thinking skills that may produce new, unique, more effective ways to fend off attacks, especially if the candidate has such prior experience.  
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Finally, mobile game design. It is relatively less important compared to the above 4, due to their universality across various sectors, even though mobile games are also a fast-growing, thriving industry at their own merit, at US$70+ billion in 2020 alone (SocialPeta 2021). Ideal candidate will be able to produce mobile games that is tailored to clients‟ needs, thoroughly tested and debugged (remove any problems occurred at any step) and delivered in maximum resolution across any mobile phone types it supports. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The plans above can be divided into 3 major sections, management, mobile applications, and automation, given mobile game development is regarded as a subsection of mobile app development, yet they are also different in the level of details being included, with games bears more complexity to utility apps. Meanwhile, security and CIO can be categorised into a particular group for being management-and communications-heavy, though, security only forms a part of specific business IT needs while CIO will oversee the entire system. Finally, automation, which bears similarity to mobile application, as both requires extensive programming to ensure the smooth operation of a specific objects, however, their core difference is that automation involves physical bots that is programmed to perform a certain function that requires observation of real-time behaviour, while mobile application is, as name suggests, a task done fully online.
